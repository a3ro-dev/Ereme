# Ereme

Ereme is a Flask web application that generates a random meme using the Imgflip API. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and the `render_template` and `jsonify` functions from Flask to render the HTML and return JSON data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Ereme, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a3ro-dev/Ereme```

Next, install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt```

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash 
 python3 main.py```
 
Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the application in action.

## Usage

Once the application is running, click the "Generate Meme" button to generate a random meme. The meme and its caption will be displayed on the page. If you'd like to generate a new meme, simply click the button again.
